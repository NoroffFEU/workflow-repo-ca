# Workflow Repo

## Project Description

The Workflow Repo is a venue booking application designed to let users explore and book venues seamlessly. This project focuses on providing a dynamic and responsive user experience, utilizing modern technologies like Vanilla JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and Playwright for testing. With features such as user authentication, detailed venue pages, and a clean UI, this app ensures a smooth experience for both users and developers.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register, log in, and manage bookings securely.
- **Venue Browsing:** View a list of venues, open detailed pages, and explore options.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Integrated Playwright tests for verifying functionality.
- **Styling:** Clean and modern UI built with TailwindCSS.

## Navigate

### Steps:
1. **Navigate to the home page:**
   - Open the browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`.
2. **Wait for the venue list to load:**
   - Ensure the venues load dynamically by watching for the list to appear.
3. **Click on the first venue:**
   - The first venue in the list is clickable, leading to the details page.
4. **Verify the details page:**
   - Confirm that the page heading displays "Venue details" after the page has loaded.

This ensures the applicationâ€™s primary functionality works as expected.
